Github help us collaborate 
our version control we can automate

by using a social interface
The 'final version' is impossible to misplace

It's usefulness I cannot overstate
GIT and Github are really great!

It also acts as a handy showcase
For our clean and well written codebase

It's use in the contemporary workplace
is more than commonplace 
so please embrace
this addition to the poem ... I should erase!
